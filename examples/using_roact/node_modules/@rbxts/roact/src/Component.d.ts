	 * `render` describes what a component should display at the current instant in time.
	 *
	 * **Info:** Roact assumes that `render` act likes a pure function: the result of `render` must depend only on
	 * `props` and `state`, and it must not have side-effects.
	 *
	 * ```lua
	 * function MyComponent:render()
	 *     -- This is okay:
	 *     return Roact.createElement("TextLabel", {
	 *         Text = self.props.text,

	 *         Text = self.someText,
	 *         Position = getMousePosition(),
	 *     })
	 * end
	 * ```
	 *
	 * `render` must be defined for all components. The default implementation of `render` throws an error; if your
	 * component does not render anything, define a render function that returns `nil` explicitly. This helps make sure
	 * that you don't forget to define `render`!
	 *

	 * 	return nil

	/**
	 * `setState` requests an update to the component's state. Roact may schedule this update for a later time or
	 * resolve it immediately.
	 *
	 * If a function is passed to `setState`, that function will be called with the current state and props as
	 * arguments:
	 *
	 * ```lua
	 * function MyComponent:didMount()
	 *     self:setState(function(prevState, props)
	 *         return {
	 *             counter = prevState.counter + 1
	 *         }
	 *     end)
	 * end
	 * ```
	 *
	 * If this function returns `nil`, Roact will not schedule a re-render and no state will be updated.
	 *
	 * If a table is passed to `setState`, the values in that table will be merged onto the existing state:
	 * ```lua
	 * function MyComponent:didMount()
	 *     self:setState({
	 *         foo = "bar"
	 *     })
	 * end
	 * ```
	 *
	 * Setting a field in the state to `Roact.None` will clear it from the state. This is the only way to remove a field
	 * from a component's state!
